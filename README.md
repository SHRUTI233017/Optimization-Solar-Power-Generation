## 🧠 Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tasks Performed:

Data Cleaning – removed unwanted rows, duplicates, and standardized columns

Data Type Conversion – converted timestamps and numeric fields

Data Integration – merged Inverter and Weather (WMS) datasets

Data Transformation – formatted and rounded numeric data

Data Visualization – histograms, scatterplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmap


Key Insights:

Peak power generation occurs between 11 AM – 2 PM

High irradiance → higher inverter output

Rainy conditions cause ~20 % drop in performance

Temperature stability improves power efficiency
